# PRODIGY_DS_03 
# Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

In Task-03 of my internship with Prodigy Infotech, I developed a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data. Leveraging the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I explored, preprocessed, and visualized the data using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. After building and training the classifier using scikit-learn, I evaluated its performance, achieving an accuracy of XX% on the test dataset. Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV further improved the model's accuracy. The decision tree visualization provided insights into the key features influencing purchase decisions. This project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and model interpretation, acquired during my internship with Prodigy Infotech.
