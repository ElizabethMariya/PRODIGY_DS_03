# PRODIGY_DS_03 
**Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction**
In Task-03 of my internship with Prodigy Infotech, I developed a decision tree classifier to predict customer purchase behavior based on demographic and behavioral data. Leveraging the Bank Marketing dataset, I explored, preprocessed, and visualized the data using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. The decision tree visualization provided insights into the key features influencing purchase decisions. This project showcases my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and model interpretation, acquired during my internship with Prodigy Infotech.
